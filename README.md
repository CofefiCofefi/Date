# Comp 3450 Project #2 - "Date"
Seth Roberts

This is a class named `Date` which enforces an invariant that the object always represents a valid date. There are also unit tests that we wrote to test our code as we developed it. This project was intended to strengthen our skills and knowledge of: `static`, `const`, constructors, destructors, and a few other concepts.

I referenced Stack Overflow a couple of times when I was confused about syntax, but I primarily used the notes posted to the Object Basics module page.

There are no special instructions.

My code isnâ€™t necessarily the most efficient, so if I were to do it over again, I would change that.

Since I had more time to complete this assignment due to my surgery, I spent a lot of extra time exploring details that I might have previously glossed over due to time constraints. I feel that I have learned much more because I allowed myself to be curious and explore topics that came to mind while writing.
